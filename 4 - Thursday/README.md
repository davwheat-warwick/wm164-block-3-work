# WM164 Smart Solutions Development I / Block 3 / Thursday

## Homework

### Can you guess what is in the class body of exception classes?

Message and stack trace attributes.

Some method which converts the class to a readable string, which is how it is outputted to the console.

### What are the measures of software quality? How to avoid bugs?

- Handling exceptions appropriately
  - Use `try`/`catch` with specific exception classes
  - Handle the exception rather than just logging it and continuing
- Use test-driven development to catch bugs as the software is developed instead of in production
- Make code self-descriptive and well-documented so anyone can understand and work on the code
- Don't ignore compiler warnings by default
