## Homework

### What does _batteries inlcuded_ mean in relation to Python?

This means that Python is designed to have everything you need included in its built-ins or included modules, giving it a head-start over other programming languages where many third-party libraries may be needed.

### How many different types of comments exist in [this PEP 8 Cheatsheet](./pep8_cheat.pdf)?

- docstrings (`"""blah"""`)
- single line comments (`# comment`)
- inline comments (`a = 1 # sets a to 1`)
